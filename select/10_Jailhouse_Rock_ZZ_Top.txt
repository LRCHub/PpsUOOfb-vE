Goin' to a party in the county jail
Prison band was there and they began to wail
Kid is shakin' and began to sing
You should've heard them knocked out jailbirds sing
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock
Spider Murphy sittin' on a block of stone
Little Joey blowin' on a slide trombone
Come on, Silly Willy, don't you be no square
If you cannot find a partner, use a wooden chair
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rockin'

Shifty Henry said to Bugs, for heaven's sake
No one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, nix nix
Wanna stick around while and get my kicks
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancin' to the jailhouse rock

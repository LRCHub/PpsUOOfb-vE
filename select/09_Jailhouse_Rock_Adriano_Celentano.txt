The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block, let's rock
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the purple gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block, let's rock
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Number 47 said to number 3:
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me"

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block, let's rock
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

The sad sack was sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square"
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block, let's rock
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Number 47 said to number 3:
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me"

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block, let's rock
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock

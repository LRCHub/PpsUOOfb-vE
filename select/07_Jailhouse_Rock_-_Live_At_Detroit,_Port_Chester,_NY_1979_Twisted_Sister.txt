Warden threw a party in the county jail
Prison band plays, they began to wail
Band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
Should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

()

Let's rock
Everybody let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancin' to a jailhouse rock

Shifty Henry said, for the heaven's sake
No one lookin', now our chance to make a break
Bugs turned to Shifty, said nix nix
Gonna stick around, gonna get my kicks

(REPEAT)

Number Forty zero said to number Three
You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
Sure I'd be delighted with your company
Come on and do the jailhouse cock with me

(REPEAT)

(Solo - left: Jay Jay, right: Eddie)

Sad sack was sittin' on a block of stone
Over in the floor weepin' all alone
Warden said, hey buddy, don'tcha be no square
Can't find a partner, f**k a wooden chair

(REPEAT)

Shifty Henry said, for the heaven's sake
No one lookin', now our chance to make a break
Bugs turned to Shifty, said nix nix
Gonna stick around, I wanna get my kicks

(REPEAT)

Dancin' to a jailhouse rock
Dancin' to a jailhouse rock
Dancin' to a jailhouse rock
Dancin' to a jailhouse rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancin' to a jailhouse rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Said, a-dancin' to a jailhouse rock

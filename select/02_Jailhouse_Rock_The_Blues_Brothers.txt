Warden threw a party in the county jail
Prisonband was there and they began to wail
The joint was jumping and the place began to swing
You should have heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
They was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash boom bang
The whole rhythm section was the purple gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
They was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Well, number 47 said to number 3
You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure'll be delighted with your company
Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me

Let's rock, everybody let's rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
They were dancing to the jailhouse rock
Let's rock

Sad Sack sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone
The warden said, "Hey buddy, don't you be no square
Can't find a partner, use a wooden chair"

Let's rock, everybody let's rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
They was dancing to the jailhouse rock

They were dancing to the jailhouse rock
They was dancing to the jailhouse rock
They was dancing to the jailhouse rock

They was dancing to the jailhouse rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
They was dancing to the jailhouse rock

They was dancing to, dancing to, dancing to, dancing to
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Oh, they was dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing

Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
They was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Jailhouse rock, they was dancin' to the jailhouse rock
They was dancin' to the jailhouse rock
They was dancin' to the jailhouse rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
They was dancing to the jailhouse rock
